1. You work at an e-commerce company that sells three goods: widgets, doodads, and fizzbangs. The head of advertising asks you which they should feature in their new advertising campaign. You have data on individual visitors' sessions (activity on a website, pageviews, and purchases), as well as whether or not those users converted from an advertisement for that session. You also have the cost and price information for the goods.Are people who click on ads typically already familiar with the products?  (Ie. they make purchases with very little activity on the website?)

If ad clickers are typically already familiar, then advertise the most profitable product  without consideration to website activity. (units sold*(price-cost))

If ad clickers are typically not familiar with the products, advertise the product which yields the highest profit when a user explores the website for a moderate/high amount of time.

2. You work at a web design company that offers to build websites for clients. Signups have slowed, and you are tasked with finding out why. The onboarding funnel has three steps: email and password signup, plan choice, and payment. On a user level you have information on what steps they have completed as well as timestamps for all of those events for the past 3 years. You also have information on marketing spend on a weekly level.

Use time series plots to compare how the follow factors have changed over the last 3 years:

DROPOUTS
Analyze time series data to understand if dropout rates have been increasing in any segment of the funnel :
- Dropout rate during account creation
- Dropout rate during choose plan
- Dropout rate during payment 

MARKETING SPEND
Analyze marketing spend over last 3 years to see if it has been decreasing over time, which may also explain drop in sales.

3. You work at a hotel website and currently the website ranks search results by price. For simplicity's sake, let's say it's a website for one city with 100 hotels. You are tasked with proposing a better ranking system. You have session information, price information for the hotels, and whether each hotel is currently available.

This is a Machine Learning Problem.

First, determine which hotels are booked most often.

Collect features on each hotel and identify each feature with a numeric score (ie. Pool (0 or 1), price, distance from city center, luxurious, etc.

If you don’t have feature list for hotels, use session information to see which pages are visited for each hotel (ie. Location, breakfast, amenities, etc.)

Determine which combination of features contribute to a hotel being booked more often.  Linear Regression Equation: features x to predict Y (prob of booking).  

Use the equation to rank the hotels by calculated prob of booking.  The only factor that will change in a given day is price.  The ranking will change daily as price changes.  The list can be labeled as sorted by “most popular” or “best deals”

4. You work at a social network, and the management is worried about churn (users stopping using the product). You are tasked with finding out if their churn is atypical. You have three years of data for users with an entry for every time they've logged in, including the timestamp and length of session.

Determine what typical churn (over the last 3 year) looks like with respect to 2 factors:
- pattern in login frequency in period leading up to user dropping service
- Pattern in session duration in period leading up to user dropping service

Determine what recent churn (over the last 6 months) looks like with respect to the same 2 factors

Do the patterns look similar?  Or atypical?
