For each of these scenarios decide if you could use supervised or unsupervised techniques, or both!



1. Define the likelihood that an individual will contract a specific disease

Supervised. Use a classifying model such as KNN, RF, Logistic Regression, SVC.



2. Translate a set of images into variables for modeling

Unsupervised. 



3. An ecommerce company wants to identify power users

Unsupervised.  



4. That same company wants to see shopping patterns in users

Unsupervised and Supervised.
Unsupervised to cluster various buying patterns.
Supervised to use those buying patterns against labeled buying data to understand cause/effect.



5. You want to reduce the number of variables inputting into your random forest model

Unsupervised.  Dimensiality reduction.
